# tsRustResult ✨🦀💖

A lightweight, zero-dependency TypeScript library that brings Rust's `Result` type to your JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Handle errors gracefully with type safety and functional programming patterns. 🌸✨

## Installation 🌈

```bash
npm install ts-rust-result
# or
yarn add ts-rust-result
# or
pnpm add ts-rust-result
```

## Why tsRustResult Exists ✨

Error handling in JavaScript and TypeScript is fundamentally broken. Here's what we're dealing with: 💔

### The Problem with Traditional Error Handling 🌪️

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling** 💔 - Some functions throw exceptions, others return `null`/`undefined`, and others return error objects. There's no standard way to handle failures.

2. **Type Safety Issues** 😱 - TypeScript can't guarantee that you've handled all error cases. A function might return `User | null`, but TypeScript won't force you to check for `null`.

3. **Error Propagation Hell** 🔥 - You end up with deeply nested try-catch blocks or error checking at every level of your call stack.

4. **Lost Context** 😢 - When errors bubble up through multiple layers, you lose the original context and stack trace information.

5. **Unpredictable Control Flow** 🌪️ - Exceptions can be thrown from anywhere, making it hard to reason about your code's execution path.

### What RustResult Accomplishes ✨🦄

RustResult provides a **consistent, type-safe, and ergonomic** way to handle errors by treating them as values rather than exceptions. This approach:

- **Eliminates the guesswork** 🎯 - No more wondering "what if this fails?"
- **Forces explicit error handling** 🛡️ - TypeScript's type system has your back!
- **Preserves error context** 💎 - Keep all the important details throughout your call chain
- **Makes control flow predictable** 🎪 - Easy to follow and reason about
- **Enables functional programming patterns** 🌈 - Transform and compose with style!

### Real-World Impact 🌟

Instead of error-prone traditional patterns with inconsistent error handling, you get a clean, type-safe approach where TypeScript forces you to handle both success and error cases explicitly.

## Features ✨

- 🦀 **Rust-style Result types** - `Ok<T>` and `Err` with full TypeScript support
- 🛡️ **Type-safe error handling** - No more throwing exceptions everywhere
- 🔧 **Functional utilities** - `map`, `mapErr`, `unwrap`, and more
- ⚡ **Async support** - `tryResult` for wrapping async operations
- 🧪 **Assertion helpers** - `assert`, `assertOr`, `assertNotNil` with Result returns
- 📦 **Zero dependencies** - Lightweight and tree-shakeable
- 🎯 **TypeScript-first** - Full type safety and IntelliSense support

## Benefits 💖

### For Developers ✨
- **Better Developer Experience** 🌟 - IntelliSense and TypeScript will guide you to handle all error cases
- **Reduced Cognitive Load** 🧠 - No more wondering "what if this fails?" - the type system tells you
- **Cleaner Code** 🎀 - Eliminate deeply nested try-catch blocks and error checking
- **Functional Programming** 🌈 - Chain operations with `map`, `mapErr`, and other functional utilities

### For Teams 👯‍♀️

- **Performance** ⚡ - No exception throwing overhead in the happy path
- **Maintainability** 🏗️ - Clear separation between success and error logic

## Quick Start 🌸

Import the library and start using Rust-style Result types for type-safe error handling.

## API Reference 📚

### Core Types 💎

```typescript
type Ok<T> = { ok: true; value: T };
type Err = { ok: false; error: Error };
type Result<T> = Ok<T> | Err;
```

### Core Functions ✨

#### `ok<T>(value: T): Result<T>` 🌸
Creates a successful result.

#### `err(error: Error): Result<never>` 💔
Creates an error result.

#### `isOk<T>(result: Result<T>): result is Ok<T>` ✅
Type guard to check if a result is successful.

#### `isErr<T>(result: Result<T>): result is Err` ❌
Type guard to check if a result is an error.

### Utility Functions 🔧

#### `unwrap<T>(result: Result<T>): T` 🎁
Unwraps a result, throwing the error if it's an error.

#### `map<T, U>(result: Result<T>, fn: (value: T) => U): Result<U>` 🗺️
Maps a successful result value using the provided function.

#### `mapErr<T>(result: Result<T>, fn: (err: Error) => Error): Result<T>` 🔄
Maps an error result using the provided function.

### Async Support ⚡

#### `tryResult<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>, shouldThrow?: boolean): Promise<Result<T>>` 🌊
Wraps an async function in a try-catch block and returns a Result.

### Assertion Helpers 🧪

#### `assert(condition: boolean, error?: Error, shouldThrow?: boolean): Result<true>` ✅
Rust-style assertion that returns a Result instead of throwing.

#### `assertOr<T extends Error>(condition: boolean, error: T, shouldThrow?: boolean): Result<true>` 🎯
Rust-style assertion with a typed error parameter.

#### `assertNotNil<T>(value: T | null | undefined, message?: string, shouldThrow?: boolean): Result<NonNullable<T>>` 💎
Asserts that a value is not null or undefined, returning the value if valid.

## Usage Pattern 🎪

RustResult follows a specific pattern to maintain clean separation between error handling and business logic:

### **Function Design: Return Results Directly** ✨

Functions that can fail should implement appropriate error handling and return `Result<T>` directly, using `ok()` for success and `err()` for failures.

### **Function Calls: Use tryResult() for Exception Wrapping** 🌊

When calling functions that might throw (like third-party APIs, database calls, or existing code), wrap the call with `tryResult()`.

### **Anti-Pattern: Don't Wrap Your Own Functions** 🚫

If you find yourself wrapping your own functions in `tryResult()`, you're doing it wrong.

### **The Rule:** 📏
- **Your functions**: Return `Result<T>` directly ✨
- **Third-party calls**: Use `tryResult()` to wrap 🌊
- **Never**: Wrap your own functions in `tryResult()` 🚫

## Real-World Examples 🌟

### API Service Layer 🌐

Create service layers that return Results directly for type-safe error handling.

### Validation Layer ✅

Build validation functions that return Results for clear error handling.

### Database Operations 🗄️

Handle database operations with Results for consistent error management.

## Migration Guide 🚀

### From Traditional Error Handling 🔄

Migrate from traditional try-catch patterns to Result-based error handling for better type safety and consistency.

### From Promise-based Error Handling 🌊

Convert Promise-based error handling to Result patterns for more predictable control flow.

## Performance Considerations ⚡

- **Zero Runtime Overhead** 🚀 - Results are just plain objects with no hidden costs
- **Tree-shakeable** 🌳 - Only include the functions you actually use
- **No Dependencies** 📦 - No external libraries to load or parse
- **TypeScript-only** 🎯 - No runtime type checking overhead

## Browser Support 🌍

- **Modern Browsers** 🌐 - ES2020+ features (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13.1+)
- **Node.js** 🟢 - 16.0.0+
- **TypeScript** 🔵 - 4.5+

### Common Issues ❓

**Q: Why not just use try-catch everywhere?** 🤔
A: Try-catch doesn't provide type safety and can make control flow unpredictable. Results make error handling explicit and type-safe.

**Q: Isn't this just more verbose?** 📝
A: Initially yes, but it prevents bugs and makes your code more maintainable in the long run.

**Q: Can I mix Results with traditional error handling?** 🔄
A: Yes! Use `tryResult` to wrap existing async functions and gradually migrate your codebase.
